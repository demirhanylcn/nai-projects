Wikipedia) as successful in retaining their active editors on a renewable and sustained basis, with their numbers remaining relatively constant at approximately 42,000.[27]A "WikiProject" is a group of contributors who want to work together as a team to improve Wikipedia. These groups may focus on a specific topic area (for example, women's history), a specific location or a specific kind of task (for example, checking newly created pages). As of August 2022, the English Wikipedia had over 2,000 WikiProjects, for which activity varied.[40]In 2007, in preparation for producing a print version, the English Wikipedia introduced an assessment scale of the quality of articles.[41] Articles are rated by WikiProjects. The range of quality classes begins with "Stub" (very short pages), followed by "Start", "C" and "B" (in increasing order of quality). Community peer review is needed for the article to enter one of the quality classes: either "good article", "A" or the highest, "featured article". Of the about 6.5 million articles and lists assessed as of April 2022, more than 6,000 (0.09%) are featured articles, and fewer than 4,000 (0.06%) are featured lists. One featured article per day, as selected by editors, appears on the main page of Wikipedia.[42][43]The Wikipedia Version 1.0 Editorial Team has developed a table (shown below) that displays data of all rated articles by quality and importance, on the English
Wikipedia. If an article or list receives different ratings by two or more WikiProjects, then the highest rating is used in the table, pie-charts, and bar-chart. The software auto-updates the data.Researcher Giacomo Poderi found that articles tend to reach featured status via the intensive work of a few editors.[44] A 2010 study found unevenness in quality among featured articles and concluded that the community process is ineffective in assessing the quality of articles.[45]Community-produced news publications include The Signpost.[46] The Signpost (previously known as The Wikipedia Signpost)[47] is the English Wikipedia's newspaper.[46][48][49] It is managed by the Wikipedia community and is published online weekly.[46][50] Each edition contains stories and articles related to the Wikipedia community.[51][52]The publication was founded in January 2005 by Wikipedia administrator and later Chair of the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, Michael Snow.[46][47][53] Originally titled The Wikipedia Signpost, it was later
shortened to The Signpost.[47][54] The newspaper reports on Wikipedia events including Arbitration Committee rulings,[55] Wikimedia Foundation issues,[56] and other Wikipedia-related projects.[57] Snow continued to contribute as a writer to The Signpost until his appointment to the Board of Trustees of the Wikimedia Foundation in February 2008.[58]Investigative journalism by The Signpost in 2015 on changes to freedom of panorama copyright restrictions in Europe was covered by publications in multiple languages including German,[59] Italian,[60] Polish,[61] and Russian.[62] Wikipedia users Gamaliel and Go Phightins! became editors-in-chief of The
