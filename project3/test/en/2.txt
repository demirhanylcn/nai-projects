Sigmaringen Castle (German: Schloss Sigmaringen) was the princely castle and seat of government for the Princes of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.  Situated in the Swabian Alb region of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany, this castle dominates the skyline of the town of Sigmaringen.  The castle was rebuilt following a fire in 1893, and only the towers of the earlier medieval fortress remain.  Schloss Sigmaringen was a family estate of the Swabian Hohenzollern family, a cadet branch of the Hohenzollern family, from which the German Emperors and kings of Prussia came.  During the closing months of World War II, Schloss Sigmaringen was briefly the seat of the Vichy French Government after France was liberated by the Allies.  The castle and museums may be visited throughout the year, but only on guided tours. It is still owned by the Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen family, although they no longer reside there.
