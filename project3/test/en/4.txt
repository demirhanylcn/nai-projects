In addition to the above, Patkar was a commissioner on the World Commission on Dams, which did thorough research on the environmental, social, political and economic aspects and impacts of the development of large dams globally and their alternatives.

She has been a part of numerous teams and panels that work on initiating and formulating various national policies and enactments including those related to land acquisition, unorganized sector workers, hawkers, slum-dwellers and forest-dweller Adivasis. NAPM filed several public interest litigations including those against Adarsh society, Lavasa Megacity, Hiranandani(Powai) and as well as other builders. Noted Economist Swaminathan criticized Medha Patkar saying she was wrong on Narmada project. Prime Minister Modi said that Medha Patkar and her â€œurban Naxalâ€ friends had opposed and delayed the Narmada project that had greatly benefited Gujarat. In fact, the project was opposed by a very wide range of critics including the World Bankâ€™s Morse Commission which was anything but â€œurban Naxal.â€ In 2000, Medha Patkar was included in the 100 heroes of the 20th century by Time.
