The Chicago Pythons were a professional indoor football team based in Homer Glen, Illinois. The team was a member of the Continental Indoor Football League (CIFL). The Pythons joined the CIFL in 2012 as an expansion team under the name "Chicago Vipers". They changed their name to the "Chicago Pythons" four weeks into the season. The Pythons were the third indoor football team based in the Chicago area. The Chicago Rush of the Arena Football League were based in Rosemont, and the Chicago Slaughter of the Indoor Football League are based in Hoffman Estates. The Pythons replaced the Chicago Knights, formerly the Chicago Cardinals, as the Illinois-based CIFL team, which replaced the Slaughter after they left for the Indoor Football League after a dispute with CIFL management. The Owner of the Pythons was Michael Duran. The Pythons were supposed to play their home games at The Megaplex in Homer Glen, Illinois, but the team never hosted a home game.
