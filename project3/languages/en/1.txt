Joan Luedders Wolfe (May 2, 1929 â€“ January 23, 2021) was an environmental activist who founded the West Michigan Environmental Action Council in 1968. She has been described as "one of the mothers of the modern environmental movement", often acting on a national or global level to achieve local change.Wolfe coordinated the drafting and passage of the landmark Michigan Environmental Protection Act of 1970. At Wolfe's request, the law was written by University of Michigan law professor Joseph Sax. The legislation became the model for similar statutes in twelve other states, and the basis for federal and international environmental law. She and her husband, Willard E. Wolfe, DDS (March 8, 1926 â€“ February 16, 2011), were also key strategists in writing and lobbying for passage of Michigan's Inland Lakes and Streams Act of 1972.
